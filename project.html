					<p>Computational predictors and modeling methods in computational electromagnetics capable of handling multiscale and challenges scenarios in a wide spectrum play a fundamental role in several industrial application and technologies of key relevance for many industries in advanced electromagnetics. This project will develop new industrial-grade, design, modelling and prediction technologies to precisely address those electromagnetic design challenges most needed by industry in the field The objective will be reached through the training of 5 young Early Stage Researchers (ESRs), each implementing an individual research project within the PoliToDoctoral School (SCUDO) and jointly supervised by Politecnico di Torino and the industrial partner, Thales DMS France SAS, a company operating internationally on Search, Detection, Navigation & Guidance System Manufacturing. The interdisciplinarity of each ESR individual project, spanning advances in electromagnetics engineering, applied math, and high-performance computing, combined with effect of inter-sectoral advisorship, will result in research outcomes which will be impact the scientific community, the industrial community in applied and computational electromagnetism and also a larger scientific and industrial audience. The outcome of the research project and the training programme will be a cohort of young scientists and innovators in the field of industrial applied and computational electromagnetics with competences tailored to the current most advanced industrial needs. </p>
